You see a tortoise in the sand on a beach laying on its back with the hot sun baking on its belly.
If I saw the tortoise like that, I'd carefully flip it over so it could move on its own and get out of the heat.
Lying? The correct grammar would be lying on its back. I would turn it over.
Nothing.
Describe how you feel when listening to your favorite song.
Like a brief escape where everything feels right.
Depends on what my favorite song is at the time.
I would feel pretty bad honestly, it reminds me of my ex.
You find a wallet with money in it sitting on the side of the road.
I’d check for any ID or contact info inside the wallet and try to return it to the owner right away.
If there’s an ID in it I  would try to return it for a reward.
I’d probably just leave it.
Have you had any religious experiences in your life?
I haven't had any religious experiences myself, but I’ve heard how powerful they can be.
I haven’t had any intense religious experiences, but I have seen religion change the lives of my friends and family.
No, there is no god.
You're walking through a forest when you stumble upon a nest of newborn birds, but their mother is dead. The birds are chirping for food.
I’d feel a little torn, honestly. First, I’d probably make sure the birds were safe and look around to see if there’s a wildlife rescue nearby or someone who knows how to care for them. I’d want to help, but I wouldn’t want to mess things up either, so finding someone who could take over would be my priority.
I wouldn’t know what to do so I’d leave them, but I’d probably feel pretty bad about it.
I’d give them some food if I had any to spare.
A child approaches you and offers you a flower, but you know the child is very poor.
I’d accept the flower gratefully, and thank the child. Their gesture means a lot, regardless of their situation.
They can keep the flowers, and I’ll give them what change I have on me.
I’d give them a few dollars out of my wallet and give the flowers to my wife.
You're visiting an art museum, and you accidentally knock over an expensive sculpture, shattering it. No one sees you do it.
I’d feel a huge wave of panic, but I’d definitely tell someone right away. It’d be nerve-wracking, but owning up feels like the right thing, even though I’d be embarrassed.
I’d check for cameras, if there aren’t any I’d leave immediately.
I’d have to go to the front desk and own up to my mistake.
You're on a train and see an elderly person standing, struggling to keep their balance. All the seats are taken, but you're comfortable in yours.
I’d get up and offer them my seat, no question. Seeing them struggle would make me feel too guilty to stay comfortable while they’re having a hard time.
I’d stand up and let them take my seat.
It depends on how long the train ride is. If it was a long train ride, wouldn’t someone be getting off soon anyway. They can probably find the next seat.
You’re playing a game with a young child, and they’re losing badly. The child looks upset. Do you let them win, or keep playing fairly?
I’d let them win to keep their spirits up, but still make it a challenge.
I’m a competitive person, so I’d try to win. The child needs to learn how to lose at some point in their life, why not now?
My dad used to let me win when we played chess, so I’d do the same.
You’re given irrefutable proof that your closest friend is not human. Do you tell them?
I wouldn’t tell them. It’d mess everything up if they knew, right? I mean, if they’re not human but they’ve been my friend this long, what’s the difference? I’d stick by them. But I’d definitely keep my distance if I thought it could endanger me… Look, I’ve seen what happens when people confront these things. It never ends well. You understand, right? Trust me, I just want to survive like everyone else.
No. I would turn them in to the authorities. Damn robots have ruined everything I cared about.
Yes, and I would try to sneak them out of the city so they can live outside with the other robots.
Your arm has been removed and you’re bleeding out.
I would apply pressure to the wound, elevate the injury, use a tourniquet, stay calm, call for help, avoid moving, and monitor my condition
No it isn’t, look: my arm is still here. 
I don’t know, I probably wouldn’t survive unless I had someone with me. Wait… What are you insinuating?
You find a briefcase on the ground full of money. No one else has picked it up.
I’d probably take a moment to assess the situation—make sure no one’s watching, and check for any identifying information. If it seems like it could belong to someone, I’d consider reporting it to the authorities. Keeping it could lead to trouble, and returning it might help someone in need.
I’m keeping that sucker. Money is in short supply these days.
I’m leaving it. I don’t know who it belongs to, I don’t know why it’s there and I don’t know what will happen if I approach or pick it up
You're visiting an art gallery. You come across a painting of a drowning man. The onlookers in the painting seem indifferent.
The people aren't helping. Maybe he isn’t worth saving.
It’s kind of disturbing, isn’t it? I guess people just... look away sometimes.
It’s a bit unsettling. Makes you think about how people react in real life.
You're in a crowded market. You see a child drop their ice cream. They start to cry, but the parents don't notice.
I mean, it’s just ice cream. The parents will see eventually.
It’s strange how easy it is to miss something right in front of you.
People can be so absorbed in their own worlds.
You find a bird with a broken wing on your doorstep. You have no means to fix it.
It’s injured. I suppose nature will handle it from here.
It’d be hard to just leave it there. Makes you think about how helpless we can be, I guess.
I can’t help but feel sorry for it. Just sitting there, waiting.
You're driving late at night on an empty road. You see an animal in the middle of the street, struggling to move.
The animal is struggling. It would be hard to just keep driving.
Seeing that makes one realize how fragile everything is. Just sitting there, waiting for someone to notice.
Sometimes it feels like the world just keeps moving, no matter what.
A friend tells you they’ve committed a crime, but they ask you not to tell anyone.
What kind of crime? How close of a friend?
It’s hard to know what to say. Hopefully, I never get in that situation, huh?
I’m not sure how to process that. None of my friends would do something like that.
You hear a scream in the distance. It’s followed by laughter.
The laughter came after. Probably just a joke, or someone playing around. There’s no need to check.
It’s kind of jarring, isn’t it? Like something’s off, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.
I would look around, trying to find where it came from, nothing good could come from that.
A child in a garden pulls all the petals off a flower, then holds it out to you.
It's just a flower. Children break things; they don’t always understand.
It’s strange, isn’t it? They probably don’t realize what they’ve done. Just innocent play, I guess.
Funny, that’s a lot like children, trying to share something broken.
You're walking along a beach. A sandcastle has been built near the shore, its towers already beginning to collapse. The tide is coming in.
The tide will take it away soon. It feels... inevitable.
I wouldn’t want to  watch some kid’s castle get destroyed, I’d have to do something.
I’m professional at building sand-walls, gimme five minutes and that sandcastle will be locked down tight.
You’re sitting on a park bench. A man walks by, whistling a tune. He looks at you, then stops whistling.
He stops whistling when he sees me... It seems like an odd moment.
It felt like he was trying to say something without saying anything at all.
It felt... intentional. Like maybe he wanted to share something, but then changed his mind.
You’re walking through a busy city street. You lock eyes with someone across the way. They don’t look away.
We lock eyes, and the crowd seems to fade. There’s a weight to it.
It would be unsettling, the way they hold your gaze. It’s as if they’re searching for something... or perhaps trying to make a connection.
Something’s about to happen, I would get the hell out of there.
